  <h1>This website is in heavy development as our ApiRepo is being created for the new KingsButBad Server</h1>

  <p>The source code to this website is publicly available on the KingsButBad Organization!</p>
  <p>Note: This doesn't mean the ApiRepo will be. This may eventually contain the public docs on how to use it though!</p>
